/* Wrapper classes in Java are classes that encapsulate primitive data types, allowing them to be treated as objects. 
Java's primitive data types (like int, char, float, etc.) are not objects, 
but wrapper classes provide a way to convert them into objects when needed. 
Autoboxing - automatic conversion that java makes bw premitive to wrapper class object
Unboxing - reverse of autoboxing
